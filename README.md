# StrataFlow-GGH

StrataFlow aims to optimize the design of a Network on Chip (NOC) system within a silicon design environment. The goal is to achieve optimal performance metrics, including latency, bandwidth, buffer occupancy, and throttling frequency. This project utilizes a simulator setup and Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to derive an optimal NOC design. 
The RL technique chosen is Deep Q-Networks (DQN), to develop a robust design framework. This framework will derive optimal parameters for the NOC, considering factors like measured latency, bandwidth, buffer sizing, and throttling frequency. DQN is well-suited for problems where there is a large state space and actions have long-term consequences, which aligns with the optimization goals of the NOC design.
